# siesta.js

Siesta.js makes consuming restful web services extremely easy

The library is written in CoffeeScript, but doesn't necessarily require CoffeeScript to develop applications - you can use whichever language you're most familiar with.

## Todo

* Basic http authentication and other headers
* Make it work with direct requests for backend usage 
# better testing and more examples
# better cakefile
# documentation with docco


## Contributing

These instructions assume that you already have `hub` installed and that
you've set it up so it wraps `git` (see "Aliasing").

1. Clone hub:  
    `git clone gertfindel/siesta.js`
2. Verify that existing tests pass (see "Development dependencies"):  
    `?? test`
3. Create a topic branch:  
    `git checkout -b my_branch`
4. Make your changes â€“ it helps a lot if you write tests first
5. Verify that tests still pass:  
    `?? test`
6. Fork hub on GitHub (adds a remote named "YOUR_USER"):  
    `git fork`
7. Push to your fork:  
    `git push -u YOUR_USER my_branch`
8. Open a pull request describing your changes:  
    `git pull-request`
